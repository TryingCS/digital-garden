 labs ask for **Windows 10 as a VM**, not as host.

1. ~~Install **VirtualBox**.~~
2. Create two VMs:
   - **Kali Linux**
   - **Windows 10**
3. Use the required network mode per lab:
   - Labs 1 and 2: Bridged Adapter
   - Lab 4: Host-only/NAT as specified
1. Keep Windows Defender/SmartScreen disabled **only inside the Windows VM** when the lab requires it.

Recommended :

- RAM: **16 GB**
- Storage: at least **80–100 GB free**
- CPU virtualization enabled: **Intel VT-x / AMD-V**

If limited RAM, start needed VMs one a time.
