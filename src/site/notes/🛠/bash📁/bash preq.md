## Minimum Bash checklist

You should know these commands:

```bash
ls -la
cd folder
mkdir project
cp file.txt backup/
mv old.txt new.txt
rm -r folder
grep "error" log.txt
find . -name "*.py"
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

Basic script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "Starting setup"

for file in *.csv; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done

echo "Done"
```

Run:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

Before  7: learn **Linux navigation, permissions, pipes, grep/find, basic scripts, apt, and Python virtual environments**.

later: mostly **Docker, Hadoop/Spark, SSH, logs, automation, and running long training jobs**.
