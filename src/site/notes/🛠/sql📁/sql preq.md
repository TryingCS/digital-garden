## Concepts learned through courses

| Course | SQL concepts learned |
|---|---|
| Business Intelligence | Data warehouses, star schema, fact tables, dimension tables, OLAP, analytical SQL, dashboards |
| Big Data | HiveQL, partitioning, large-scale querying, Spark SQL, HBase-style querying |
| Data Visualization | Preparing datasets, aggregation, time-series summaries, KPI tables |
| Information Retrieval | Structured indexing, metadata queries, search-related storage |
| Project work | Application database design, CRUD operations, reporting |

## Minimum SQL

You should be able to write this:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_products,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM products
WHERE price > 100
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
```

Joins:

```sql
SELECT
    o.id,
    c.name,
    o.total
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE o.created_at >= '2026-01-01';
```

Window function:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    product,
    price,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) AS rank_in_category
FROM products;
```
